            <p>The Pokémon franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and 
                is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as 
                Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. To date, the anime, 
                which originally aired in 1997, has produced and aired over 1,000 episodes, divided into 7 series in Japan 
                and 22 seasons internationally. It is one of the longest currently running anime series. There have been 23
                films, with another scheduled to be released this year. Learn more about what makes Pokémon so special
