            <p>Princess Mononoke is an 1997 Japanese-animated epic fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, 
                and animated by Studio Ghibli. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement 
                in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term Mononoke is not 
                a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, 
                disease, or death. Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 cels in the film, and is estimated to have 
                redrawn parts of 80,000 of them. Learn more about what makes Princess Mononoke so special
