            <p>Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuhiro Watsuki. 
                The story begins during the 11th year of the Meiji period in Japan and follows a former assassin from the Bakumatsu, 
                known as Hitokiri Battosai. After his work against the bakufu, he disappears to become Himura Kenshin: a wandering swordsman 
                who protects the people of Japan with a vow never to take another life.  Studio Gallop, Studio Deen and SPE Visual Works adapted 
                the manga into an anime series which aired in Japan starting in 1996. Learn more about what makes Rurouni Kenshin
