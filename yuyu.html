            <p>Yu Yu Hakusho is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. The series 
                tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage delinquent who is struck and killed by a car while attempting 
                to save a child's life. After a number of tests presented to him by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife 
                Underworld, Yusuke is revived and appointed the title of "Underworld Detective", with which he must investigate various 
                cases involving demons and apparitions in the human world. An anime adaptation consisting of 112 television episodes was 
                directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The television series 
                originally aired on Japan's Fuji TV network from October 1992 to December 1994. It was later licensed in North America by 
                Funimation in 2001. Learn more about what makes Yu Yu Hakusho so special <a href="https://comicbook.com/anime/news/yu-yu-hakusho-best-action-anime-all-time/#1">
